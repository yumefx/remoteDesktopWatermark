# remoteDesktopWatermark
Cause the COVID-19,many people must do their job at home.
And it is easy for IT engineers to work remoteble,just like use company's vpn and use ssh for linux.  
But for many traditional job,they must use windows system and the boss do not want them let work content out.
So i made this project,check the user login from windows remote desktop,and show watermark.
Now it is not secure enough,because user can find this progress in taskmanager and taskkill it,or just logoff use the windows menu,that all shutdown the watermark,even though server will find it and send warning email.
So next time,I will add some feature to fix that,just like remote restart client.
